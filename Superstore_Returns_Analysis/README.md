# 🛍️ Retail Sales and Return Rate Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **data-driven dashboard built in Tableau** to explore sales and return behavior across product categories. By analyzing key metrics like return rates, sales volume, and category breakdowns, the dashboard helps businesses:

- Identify high-return product categories  
- Understand customer behavior  
- Make informed decisions to reduce losses from returns

This project was developed as part of my **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst bootcamp**.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Clothing and Electronics** categories exhibited the highest return rates.
- High sales volume does not always correlate with high return volume—pointing to potential quality or fit issues in specific categories.
- Opportunities exist to improve return policies, product descriptions, and sizing consistency.
