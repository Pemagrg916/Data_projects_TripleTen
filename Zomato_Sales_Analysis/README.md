# 🍽️ Zomato Sales Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Description

This project presents a comprehensive **Sales Analysis Dashboard** for **Zomato**, one of the leading food delivery platforms. The goal was to explore transaction-level data and derive actionable business insights that could help stakeholders improve decision-making, optimize operations, and boost revenue.

I built this project as part of my Business Intelligence Analyst bootcamp at **TripleTen** to demonstrate my proficiency in **data visualization** and **business analysis** using Tableau.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis

- **Top-selling items** account for a large portion of revenue — offering combos or upsells may increase order values.
- **Lunch (12–2 PM)** and **dinner (7–9 PM)** are the busiest hours — great opportunity for time-based promotions.
- **Returning customers** tend to spend more than new ones — loyalty programs could help with retention.
