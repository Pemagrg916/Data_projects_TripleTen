## 4. üß≠ Power BI Report Structure

The Power BI file contains three main pages:

### üîπ App Landscape
- Total unique apps (KPI card)
- Line chart of review count over time (`lastmod`)
- Scatterplot of average rating vs number of reviews

### üîπ Reviews
- DAX column `helpful_reviews = rating * (1 + helpful_count)`
- Card showing average helpful review score
- DAX column `developer_answered = IF(ISBLANK(developer_reply), 0, 1)`
- Scatterplot: developer_answered (X) vs average rating (Y)

### üîπ App Reviews
- Relationships built:
  - `reviews[app_id]` ‚Üí `apps[id]`
- Bar chart: Developer vs Total Rating
- Bar chart: Developer vs Average Helpful Review Score
- Bar chart: Most responsive developers (Developer vs Avg `developer_answered`), filtered to apps with more than 500 reviews

- ‚è± Developer responsiveness (responding to reviews) positively correlates with higher average ratings.
- üîù Some developers dominate in terms of total ratings, but when weighted by helpfulness, other high-quality contributors stand out.
- üÜì Freemium apps attract more reviews, which may impact visibility and perception.
